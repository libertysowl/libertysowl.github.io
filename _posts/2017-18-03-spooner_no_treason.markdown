<p>No Treason is a composition of three essays, all written in 1867: No.I, No.II: "The Constitution", and No. VI: "The Constitution of no Authority". Any essays between No. 2 and No.6 were never published under the authorship of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysander_Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a>. Lawyer by training, strong abolitionist, radical thinker, and anarchist, Spooner wrote these specific pamphlets in order to express his discontent with the state and its driving power, the U.S. Constitution. </p>
